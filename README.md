Crisis Management Game Prototype

I bought a book on simple windows Game Development (Beginning Game Programming by Michael Morrison) over my past winter break
and crushed through it in a couple of weeks. Really fun book. This is just a prototype in progress (tough to find time with 
school..) for a crises management game. I wanted the pace to require fast decisions with fast consequences with explosive audio. 
It's based off of Apollo 13 and every single anime I've ever seen. All those big robot ones. The images are all pulled from 
"Knights of Cidonia" and I want to splice in some Neon Genesis footage, and maybe some Gundam Wing. 

I've never used git before (as of 1/30/2015) so apologies if anything amiss.
The "Audio" Project is the Irklang sound engine, http://www.ambiera.com/irrklang/, and I definitely should not have included it
with my project and I'll figure out a way to remove it bronto. Again, I DID NOT make the irklang sound engine. 

The underlying "Game Engine" is also the one you develop if you follow Micael Morrison's book with some minor tweaks and changes to account for the bitmap swapping I needed to do. Those two Purple rectangles are two additional "screens" and as soon as I cut the footage I want for those I'll put those in. 

I was hoping to put in a lot more work on it before school really started to kick in but alas...
